# Secure Land Title Registry

A blockchain-based system for secure, transparent property title management

## Overview

The Secure Land Title Registry is a decentralized application that leverages blockchain technology to create an immutable, transparent record of land ownership and transactions. This system replaces traditional paper-based title registries with smart contracts that automate verification processes and provide a single source of truth for property ownership data.

## Core Components

### Transfer Verification Contract

This contract validates and processes property ownership transfers. Key features include:

- Multi-signature requirements for transaction approval
- Automated verification of seller's legitimate ownership
